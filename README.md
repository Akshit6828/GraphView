GraphView
===========

Android GraphView is used to display data in graph structures.

Overview
========
The library can be used within `RecyclerView` and currently works with small graphs only.

**This project is currently experimental and the API subject to breaking changes without notice.**

Layouts
======
### Tree
Uses Walker's algorithm with Buchheim's runtime improvements (`BuchheimWalkerLayoutManager` class). Currently only the `TreeEdgeDecoration` can be used to draw the edges. Supports different orientations. All you have to do is using the `BuchheimWalkerConfiguration.Builder.setOrientation(int)` with either `ORIENTATION_LEFT_RIGHT`, `ORIENTATION_RIGHT_LEFT`, `ORIENTATION_TOP_BOTTOM` and
`ORIENTATION_BOTTOM_TOP` (default). Furthermore parameters like sibling-, level-, subtree separation can be set.
### Directed graph
Directed graph drawing by simulating attraction/repulsion forces. For this the algorithm by Fruchterman and Reingold (`FruchtermanReingoldLayoutManager` class) was implemented. To draw the edges you can use `ArrowEdgeDecoration` or `StraightEdgeDecoration`.
### Layered graph
Algorithm from Sugiyama et al. for drawing multilayer graphs, taking advantage of the hierarchical structure of the graph (`SugiyamaLayoutManager` class). Currently only the `SugiyamaArrowEdgeDecoration` can be used to draw the edges. You can also set the parameters for node and level separation using the `SugiyamaConfiguration.Builder`.

Usage
======
GraphView must be integrated with `RecyclerView`.
For this youâ€™ll need to add a `RecyclerView` to your layout and create an item layout like usually when working with `RecyclerView`.

```xml
<com.otaliastudios.zoom.ZoomLayout
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="match_parent"
    app:hasClickableChildren="true">

    <androidx.recyclerview.widget.RecyclerView
        android:id="@+id/graphView"
        android:layout_width="wrap_content"
        android:layout_height="wrap_content" />

</com.otaliastudios.zoom.ZoomLayout>
```

Currently GraphView must be used together with a Zoom Engine like [ZoomLayout](https://github.com/natario1/ZoomLayout). To change the zoom values just use the different attributes described in the ZoomLayout project site.

To create a graph, we need to instantiate the `Graph` class. Next submit your graph to your Adapter, for that you must extend from the `AbstractGraphAdapter` class.

```java
private void setupGraphView() {
    RecyclerView graphView = findViewById(R.id.graphView);

    // 1. Set a layout manager of the ones described above that the RecyclerView will use.
    final BuchheimWalkerConfiguration configuration = new BuchheimWalkerConfiguration.Builder()
            .setSiblingSeparation(100)
            .setLevelSeparation(100)
            .setSubtreeSeparation(100)
            .setOrientation(BuchheimWalkerConfiguration.ORIENTATION_TOP_BOTTOM)
            .build();
    graphView.setLayoutManager(new BuchheimWalkerLayoutManager(context, configuration));

    // 2. Attach item decorations to draw edges
    graphView.addItemDecoration(new TreeEdgeDecoration());

    // 3. Build your graph
    final Graph graph = new Graph();
    final Node node1 = new Node("Parent");
    final Node node2 = new Node("Child 1");
    final Node node3 = new Node("Child 2");

    graph.addEdge(node1, node2);
    graph.addEdge(node1, node3);

    // 4. You will need a simple Adapter/ViewHolder.
    // 4.1 Your Adapter class should extend from `AbstractGraphAdapter`
    // 4.2 ViewHolder should extend from `RecyclerView.ViewHolder`
    adapter = new AbstractGraphAdapter<NodeViewHolder>() {
        @NonNull
        @Override
        public NodeViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
            final View view = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext()).inflate(R.layout.node, parent, false);
            return new NodeViewHolder(view);
        }

        @Override
        public void onBindViewHolder(@NonNull NodeViewHolder holder, int position) {
            holder.textView.setText(getNodeData(position).toString());
        }
    };
    graphView.setAdapter(adapter);

    // 4.3 Submit the graph
    adapter.submitGraph(graph);
}
```
